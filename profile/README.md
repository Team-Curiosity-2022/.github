## Our Project: Generating Curiosity using Natural Language Processing

Therapeutic conversations are an important part of treatment of both addictions and mental health issues. This project is collaborative with medical practitioners of the therapy, and they have pointed out that we need a better beginning to our conversation, and that good therapists employ their curiosity to start out the conversation.

The goal of this project is to build a part of a chatbot that employs curiosity in the opening of a conversation as follows
- it begins by asking one of several possible very open-ended questions - such as 'how was the last 2 weeks for you?' or 'how is your family doing now?' or 'Tell me about yourself' (You can look up lots of these online).
- next, the bot would receive a person's answer, hopefully of some length
- the core goal is to create a set of questions, that would be considered curious, based on the statements that come in response to the opening question.

The project will involve the use of recent, sophisticated Natural Language Processing models, as well as the curation of a good dataset for training. The project will measure how well the bot works by trying on real people.
